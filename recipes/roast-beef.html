    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 9.</li>
      <li>Mix 1 tsp plain flour and 1 tsp mustard powder with some seasoning, then rub all over the 950g beef top rump joint.</li>
      <li>Put 1 onion, cut into 8 wedges, and 500g carrots, halved lengthways, into a roasting tin and sit the beef on top, then cook for 20 mins.</li>
      <li>Reduce oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5 and continue to cook the beef for 30 mins if you like it rare, 40 mins for medium and 1 hr for well done.</li>
      <li>Remove the beef and carrots from the oven, place onto warm plates or platters and cover with foil to keep warm.</li>
      <li>Let the beef rest for 30 mins while you turn up the oven to cook your Yorkshire puds and finish the potatoes.</li>
      <li>For the gravy, put the tin with all the meat juices and onions back onto the hob.</li>
      <li>Stir in 1 tbsp plain flour, scraping all the stuck bits off the bottom of the tin. Cook for 30 seconds, then slowly stir in 250ml beef stock, little by little.</li>
      <li>Bubble to a nice gravy, season, then serve with the beef, carved into slices, carrots and all the other trimmings.</li>
